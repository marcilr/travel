Art in the high desert

The desert doubles as an art studio this week at Arches National Park
in Utah.  Painters from all over are congregating here for the annual
Red Rock Arts Festival.  This Moab-based event is a celebration of
what the French call painting 'en plein air,' or painting outside.
Sounds like a fabulous idea to us (and what a view!).  The colorful
landscape here at Arches National Park is home to the highest density
of natural arches in the world—upwards of 2,000—as well as hundreds
of pinnacles and dramatically balanced rocks.  Combine that with the
fiery sunsets, pinyon trees, and splashes of sage and yucca, and we'd
say these artists are in for a treat.  Lucky for them, October is one
of the most pleasant times of year to visit.
