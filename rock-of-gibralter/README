  A state-of-the-art lookout on the Rock of Gibraltar

  Make your way up the trails of this monolithic rock promontory to the Skywalk,
  an 8,000-square-foot glass platform that soars more than 1,100 feet above sea
  level.  On a clear day, you can see three countries and two continents from
  here.  These epic views draw tourists, as does the Rock’s legendary history.
  A British Overseas Territory since 1713, Gibraltar has long been a
  strategically important military outpost located near the southern tip of
  Europe on the Iberian Peninsula.  Far below the Skywalk, visitors can take in
  military relics that date back to the first years of British rule here.

  Over time, the British Armed Forces built an extensive tunnel system through
  the limestone.  The subterranean network was greatly expanded during World War
  II to accommodate 16,000 men and elaborate amenities, including a hospital,
  bakery, and water desalination plant.  In November 1942, General
  Dwight D. Eisenhower operated a command center from the tunnels for Operation
  Torch—a mission that was a turning point in the war, marking the entry of US
  forces to fight alongside the British.  The Skywalk is the newest attraction
  here, opening in March 2018 to great fanfare at a ceremony hosted by
  Mark Hamill, better known as Luke Skywalker.
