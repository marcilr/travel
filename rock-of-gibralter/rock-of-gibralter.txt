Rock of Gibraltar
=================
The Rock of Gibraltar, also known as the Rock, is a monolithic limestone
promontory located in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, near
the southwestern tip of Europe on the Iberian Peninsula.[3] It is 426 m
(1,398 ft) high.  Most of the Rock's upper area is covered by a nature
reserve, which is home to around 300 Barbary macaques.  These macaques,
as well as a labyrinthine network of tunnels, attract a large number of
tourists each year.

A state-of-the-art lookout on the Rock of Gibraltar
===================================================
Make your way up the trails of this monolithic rock promontory to the Skywalk,
an 8,000-square-foot glass platform that soars more than 1,100 feet above sea
level.  On a clear day, you can see three countries and two continents from
here.  These epic views draw tourists, as does the Rock’s legendary history.
A British Overseas Territory since 1713, Gibraltar has long been a
strategically important military outpost located near the southern tip of
Europe on the Iberian Peninsula.  Far below the Skywalk, visitors can take in
military relics that date back to the first years of British rule here.

Over time, the British Armed Forces built an extensive tunnel system through
the limestone.  The subterranean network was greatly expanded during World War
II to accommodate 16,000 men and elaborate amenities, including a hospital,
bakery, and water desalination plant.  In November 1942, General
Dwight D. Eisenhower operated a command center from the tunnels for Operation
Torch—a mission that was a turning point in the war, marking the entry of US
forces to fight alongside the British.  The Skywalk is the newest attraction
here, opening in March 2018 to great fanfare at a ceremony hosted by
Mark Hamill, better known as Luke Skywalker.
