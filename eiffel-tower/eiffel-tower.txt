It may be hard to imagine it from this angle, but the Eiffel Tower
was built so that it would be relatively easy to take down.  Constructed
as a temporary display for the 1889 World’s Fair, the wrought iron
latticework alone weighs some 7,300 tons.  In total, more than 18,000
components were joined together with 2.5 million rivets to build what
was then the tallest manmade structure on Earth. Yet engineer Gustave
Eiffel’s permit called for the tower to be disassembled after only two
decades.

While the Eiffel Tower garnered some harsh criticism after its
construction, the Parisian public and local planning officials warmed
to the structure.  It stands today as perhaps the City of Light's most
beloved symbol.
