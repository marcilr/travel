  Tapuaetai, in the Aitutaki atoll of the Cook Islands
  Look at a satellite image of the Aitutaki atoll and you’ll notice the
  startling contrast between the bright blue hue of the water inside its
  reef barrier and the darker indigo of the surrounding South Pacific Ocean.
  Yes, the water is that robin’s egg shade on this, the second most populous
  of the Cook Islands. Aitutaki, home to fewer than 3,000 lucky souls, mainly
  consists of small motus, or islets, with Tapuaetai here frequently garnering
  praise as an exceptionally stunning locale.  Also known as One Foot Island,
  it’s an idyllic spot to launch an in-depth exploration of Aitutaki’s wide,
  20-square-mile crystalline lagoon.
