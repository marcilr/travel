Eibsee, a lake in Bavaria, Germany

The flinty, dramatic heights of the Zugspitze, Germany's highest
mountain, make a fitting backdrop to the blue calm of Eibsee. 
'See' means lake in German, and the Eibsee is one of the most
beautiful lakes in the country's Bavaria region.  Roughly 60 miles
from Munich, the area draws city dwellers looking to escape into
the quiet of the Bavarian Alps.  For those who want to visit both
the lake and the top of the Zugspitze in a single day, the Eibsee
Cable Car whisks folks more than 3,000 feet up in only 10 minutes,
offering incredible views of the lake and its surroundings while
en route to the summit.
