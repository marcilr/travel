Mountaintop rice field in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park,
China

Within the sprawling and magnificent Zhangjiajie National Forest Park
is a sight that might be considered an example ‘extreme farming.’
Cultivated atop slender karst mountains are rice paddies, their
sculpted forms tucked amid the soaring, forested pillars, adding a
surreal touch to the already astonishing surroundings.  These
Fields in the Sky’ are in the Laowuchang section of an ecologically
diverse park containing a seemingly endless variety of dreamlike
vistas.  Opened in 1982, Zhangjiajie was China’s first forest park
and its nearly 12,000 acres are part of the even larger Wulingyuan
Scenic Area: 153-square-miles of pure Hunan Province ‘wow.’
