Wow, need to snag this one:

Mountain trail in Madeira, Portugal

Beyond the biodiverse forests on the outer edges of Madeira Island, 
the land rises, reminding hikers that this Portuguese island is the
tip of a shield volcano.  Trails allow passage up into these higher
elevations, including paths created from the islandâ€™s old (and
still functioning) aqueduct system.  Some of the decommissioned
channels, called levadas, have been repurposed as hiking trails.
