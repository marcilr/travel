  What, no escalator?
  On Take the Stairs Day, take some inspiration from this mountain
  path in the Ninh Bình province of Vietnam.  Or just be glad you don’t
  have to climb it.  The stone path next to the entrance of the Mua Caves
  zigzags up 486 steps that were designed in the style of the Great Wall
  of China.  At the top, you’ll find a small pagoda and panoramic views
  of the countryside.  Plus, a feeling of achievement.
