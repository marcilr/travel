To Sua Ocean Trench in Lotofaga, Upolu, Samoa
"To Sua" literally translates to English as “big hole.” While accurate, it feels 
like an understatement in this context. For adventurous visitors to Lotofaga, 
on Samoa’s Upolu island, To Sua Ocean Trench can feel like a trip to another world. 
From the natural saltwater pool, squeeze through a small lava-tube cave in the rock 
wall to find yourself on a short, sandy beach. Otherwise, the only way in and out 
of the swimming hole is that wooden ladder.
